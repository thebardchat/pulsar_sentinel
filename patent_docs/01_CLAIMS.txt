INDEPENDENT CLAIMS:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIM 1: Quantum-Adaptive Hybrid Encryption System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quantum-adaptive security system comprising:
- a hybrid encryption module combining lattice-based key encapsulation (ML-KEM) with symmetric authenticated encryption (AES-256-GCM);
- an adaptive security level controller that adjusts cryptographic parameters from NIST Level 3 (ML-KEM-768) to Level 5 (ML-KEM-1024) based on configuration;
- a key derivation function (HKDF-SHA256) deriving symmetric keys from encapsulated shared secrets;
- wherein said system maintains security against both classical computing attacks and quantum computing attacks utilizing Shor's algorithm.

NOVEL ELEMENTS:
  1. Combination of ML-KEM with AES-256-GCM in single hybrid operation
  2. Configuration-based security level scaling without code changes
  3. Defense-in-depth architecture protecting against compromise of either layer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIM 2: Agent State Record (ASR) Blockchain Anchoring System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An immutable audit system comprising:
- an agent state record generator creating cryptographically signed security event records with unique identifiers, timestamps, agent identifiers, action types, threat levels, and quantum safety status;
- a Merkle tree constructor batching multiple records into a single root hash for efficient blockchain storage;
- a blockchain interface storing said root hash on a distributed ledger network;
- a verification module capable of generating and validating Merkle proofs for any individual record against said stored root;
- wherein any modification to recorded events is cryptographically detectable.

NOVEL ELEMENTS:
  1. Combination of local storage with blockchain anchoring for efficiency
  2. PQC status tracking within audit records
  3. Independent Merkle proof verification for any single record

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIM 3: Points Toward Threat Score (PTS) Algorithm
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A threat assessment method comprising:
- calculating a weighted threat score from multiple security factors using the formula:
  PTS = (quantum_risk_factor × 0.4) + (access_violation_count × 0.3) + (rate_limit_violations × 0.2) + (signature_failures × 0.1);
- a quantum risk factor specifically measuring operations using quantum-vulnerable cryptographic algorithms;
- classifying said score into threat tiers: SAFE (PTS < 50), CAUTION (50 ≤ PTS < 150), CRITICAL (PTS ≥ 150);
- automatically applying security restrictions based on tier classification;
- providing numeric outputs suitable for integration with machine learning threat detection systems.

NOVEL ELEMENTS:
  1. Quantum risk factor as dedicated threat metric
  2. Tiered response automation based on continuous scoring
  3. AI/ML integration interface for advanced threat detection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIM 4: Self-Governance Rule Code (RC) System
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A self-governance system comprising:
- rule definitions (RC codes) encoded in application software enforcing security policies;
- corresponding rule enforcement logic deployed as smart contract code on a blockchain network;
- dual verification ensuring governance rules cannot be bypassed by compromising either application layer or blockchain layer alone;
- an heir transfer protocol (RC 1.02) automatically transferring account assets and permissions to a designated heir after a configurable inactivity period;
- a three-strike enforcement mechanism (RC 2.01) automatically restricting accounts after repeated policy violations;
- a fallback protocol (RC 3.02) directing failed transactions to alternate network infrastructure.

NOVEL ELEMENTS:
  1. Dual-layer enforcement in application AND smart contract
  2. Automated heir transfer for digital inheritance
  3. Hardcoded governance that cannot be modified without redeployment

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAIM 5: Wallet-Native Zero-Password Authentication
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A passwordless authentication method comprising:
- generating a cryptographic challenge containing a unique nonce, wallet address, and timestamp for a blockchain wallet address;
- receiving a digital signature of said challenge message from a wallet application without incurring blockchain transaction fees;
- recovering the signer's address from said signature using elliptic curve cryptography;
- verifying said recovered address matches the claimed wallet address without storing any credentials on the server;
- issuing a time-limited JSON Web Token upon successful verification for subsequent authenticated requests;
- wherein authentication is tied to cryptographic proof of private key possession rather than memorized credentials.

NOVEL ELEMENTS:
  1. Zero credential storage authentication
  2. Blockchain wallet as identity provider
  3. Phishing-resistant challenge-response protocol
