                         ABSTRACT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A quantum-adaptive blockchain-integrated security framework providing protection
against both classical and quantum computing threats. The system comprises:

(1) A hybrid encryption module combining ML-KEM lattice-based key encapsulation
    with AES-256-GCM symmetric encryption for quantum-resistant data protection;

(2) An Agent State Record (ASR) system creating immutable, blockchain-anchored
    audit trails with Merkle proof verification for tamper-evident logging;

(3) A Points Toward Threat Score (PTS) algorithm providing continuous threat
    assessment with a novel quantum risk factor for incentivizing PQC adoption;

(4) A Self-Governance Rule Code (RC) system enforcing tamper-proof policies
    through dual application/smart-contract layers with heir transfer capability;

(5) A wallet-native authentication system eliminating password vulnerabilities
    through cryptographic challenge-response tied to blockchain identity.

The framework is designed to scale security parameters as quantum computing
capabilities increase, ensuring long-term protection of digital assets.
