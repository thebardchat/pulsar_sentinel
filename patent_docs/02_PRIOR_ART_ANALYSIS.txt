--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    NOVELTY STATEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PULSAR SENTINEL's novelty lies in the COMBINATION and INTEGRATION of:

1. Post-quantum cryptography (ML-KEM) with classical encryption (AES-GCM)
   in a single hybrid operation with automatic security level scaling.

2. Blockchain-anchored audit trails with Merkle proof verification,
   enabling independent verification without full on-chain storage.

3. A novel quantum risk factor in threat scoring that specifically
   tracks and penalizes use of quantum-vulnerable cryptographic operations.

4. Dual-layer governance enforcement in both application code AND
   smart contracts, with automated heir transfer protocol.

5. Wallet-native authentication that eliminates all credential storage
   while providing phishing-resistant identity verification.

No prior art combines all five innovations into a unified security framework
designed to adapt and scale with quantum computing advancements.
